# Lesson 6

## Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND
* **o** opens a line **below** the cursor and places you in Insert mode
* **O** does the same, but opens the line **above** the cursor

## Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND
* **a** appends text **after** the cursor
* _NOTE: **a**, **i** and **A** all go to Insert mode, the only difference is where the characters are inserted

## Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE
* **R** replaces more than 1 character
* **NOTE: Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every character deletes an existing character**

## Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT
* **y** operator copies text, **p** operator pastes it
* we can use **v** to get into Visual mode and select the content we want to copy
* we can also use **y** as an operator (**yw** yanks (copies) one word, etc.)

## Lesson 6.5: SET OPTION
