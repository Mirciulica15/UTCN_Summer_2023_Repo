# .gitignore

## When we are working on some project, we sometimes want some files and directories to not be synchronized with the remote repository

### What kind of files can they be?
* artifacts
* tarballs
* temp files
* binaries
* additional libraries (needed for compilation, for example)
* other
 
### .gitignore gives us the possibility to control what will be synchronized
* add what you don't want to synchronize inside **.gitignore**

### More configs
* if we have things with the same name or pattern, we need to be as specific as possible
* example :
* __**/neveringit__
* **!firstdirectory/neveringit**
* first line says explicitly : all files anywhere in the structure
* in the second line, the exclamation mark negates the pattern; in another works, we negate the deny and allow this file to be sent to remote
