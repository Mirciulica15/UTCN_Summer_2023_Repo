# Conclusions

## I was familiar with **git** before, but some of the concepts in this tutorial were new.

## New things I learned:
  1. Structure of **.git** hidden file
  2. **git adog**
  3. Formatting options
  4. Querying options
  5. **git reset**
  6. **git rebase** (how to make sure **HEAD** is properly placed)
  7. How to solve conflicts
