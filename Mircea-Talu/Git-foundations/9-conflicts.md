# Conflicts

### Conflicts can happen if some number of people are working on the same project, on the same files, at the same time
### Then, when you try to commit, or merge, you find out that a _conflict_ was created

* this conflict was resolved manually, but when we are working with larger files and multiple developers we cannot do that
* usually we **discuss** with the devs and decide which **version** to keep
* they can also be resolved in GitHub
* or we can use certain tools:
  1. git-mergetool (part of the git package, you need to specify the proper tool to be invoked)
  2. plugins to your beloved editor
  3. Kdiff3
  4. Meld
