# [Swarm Mode Introduction for IT Pros](https://training.play-with-docker.com/ops-s1-swarm-intro/#)

## Docker supplies 2 tools: Docker Compose and Docker Swarm Mode

### _Compose_ is used to control multiple containers on a single system. Much like the _Dockerfile_ we looked at to build an image, there is a text file that describes the application: which images to use, how many instances, the network connections, etc. But _Compose* only runs on a single system!

### _Swarm Mode_ tells Docker that you will be running many Docker engines and you want to coordinate across all of them.
