# Conclusions

## I was familiar with Linux commands from university, but this tutorial helped me revised my knowledge and also showed me greater functionalities.

## Most important things I learned:
  1. Process structure (top, ps commands & knowing how to read process information)
  2. Scheduling tasks & working with crontab
  3. Aliases and history are very useful
  4. User priviliges
  5. Getting familiar with the filesystem
  6. Learning about the paths of certain important files and directories
