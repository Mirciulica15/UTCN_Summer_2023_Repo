# The Problem of Delivering Software

If somebody thinks of a good idea, how do we deliver it to users as quickly as possible?

<br>

## Antipatterns (Bad practices)

- _Antipattern: Deploying Software Manually_

- _Antipattern: Deploying to a Production-like Environment Only after Development Is Complete_

- _Antipattern: Manual Configuration Management of Production Environments_

<br>

## How do we deliver Useful, Working Software to users as Quickly as possible?

- **Automated Releases**

- **Frequent Releases**

<br>

## _Every Change Should Trigger the Feedback Process_

A working software application can be usefully decomposed into four components: **executable code, configuration, host environment, and data.**

<br>

## _The Feedback Must Be Received as Soon as Possible_

The key to fast feedback is **automation.**

<br>

## _The Delivery Team Must Receive Feedback and Then Act on It_

<br>

# What Are the Benefits?

## _Empowering Teams_

The deployment pipeline allows testers, operations or support personnel to self-service the version of the application they want into the environment of their choice.

<br>

## _Reducing Errors_

We need proper configuration management.

<br>

## _Lowering Stress_

More releases => less pressure!

<br>

## _Deployment Flexibility_

Easy to start your application in a new environment.

<br>

## _Practice Makes Perfect_

**Same deployment approach for every environment** => the final deployment into production is being **rehearsed** every single time the software is deployed to any target.

<br>

# The Release Candidate

The build, deployment and test process validates whether the change can be released!

<br>

## _Every Check-in Leads to a Potential Release_

Every change a developer makes to the codebase is intended to add value.

<br>

# Principles of Software Delivery

## _Create a Repeatable, Reliable Process for Releasing Software_

**Releasing should be easy!**

<br>

## _Automate Almost Everything_

<br>

## _Keep Everything in Version Control_

<br>

## _If It Hurts, Do It More Frequently, and Bring the Pain Forward_

<br>

## _Build Quality In_

Testing is **not a phase**, and certainly not one to begin after the development phase.

Don't leave testing to the end!

<br>

## _Done Means Released_

<br>

## _Everybody Is Responsible for the Delivery Process_

**NO Siloisation between departments!**

<br>

## _Continuous Improvement_

The first release of an application is **just the first stage of its life.**

**Deming cycle: plan, do, study, act.**

<br>

# Summary

**The automation of the development, test, and release processes has a profound impact on the speed, quality, and cost of the releasing software.**

By adopting these techniques, we gain the ability to **verify changes**, to **make the process reproducible across a range of environments**, and to largely **eliminate the opportunity for errors to creep into production.**

We gain the ability to **deploy changes**, and so **bring business benefits more quickly**, because the release process itself is no longer a hurdle.
