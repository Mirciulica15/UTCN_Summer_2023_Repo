creating a file:
- touch myfile
same cool trick:
- touch my{01..10}file
using * and ?:
* - anything can be there
? - anything of length 1 (character) can be there
(example : we have 3 files -> f1, f2 and f01,
touch f* -> f1, f2, f01
touch f? -> f1, f2 (NOT f01, because 01 is of length 2)
)
removing a file:
- rm myfile
- can also remove using same cool trick
using VIM:
- vim mynewfile -> creates new file called "mynewfile" and opens the vim editor
- use "i" to enter insert mode (modify file)
- use "ESC" to go back to command mode
- use ":wq" to exit vim
