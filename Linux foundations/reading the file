- cat comes from "concatenate"
- the downside of "cat" is that it prints the whole file (no matter how big)
- "file" command tells us the kind of file we have

VIM
- vim is a very weird but efficient editor
- we have 3 modes in vim: COMMAND, INSERT and VISUAL
- COMMAND : where we interact with vim and do actions
- INSERT : where we change the content of the file
- VISUAL : where we can do selection of text
- once we change the content, we exit using "ESC" and writing:
  > ":q" for quitting
  > ":q!" for quitting without making the changes
  > ":wq" for writing and then quitting (changes are made)
- if we want to enter a file in read-only mode, we use "view" instead of "vim"
(example : vim myfile, view myfile)

MORE and LESS
- more and less are used for printing a file in a controlled way
- "more" only shows a portion of the file, and we can use Enter to keep going further
- "less" is a more sophisticated command, which allows us to go both ways, up and down, in the file

HEAD and TAIL
- head myfile -> display the first 10 lines of the file (by default)
- we can the -n flag for specific number of lines
(example : head -n2 myfile -> first 2 lines)
- tail : same as head, but from the end
